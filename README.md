LLUnitTestDemo
==============
A Unit Testing demo for Sydney Cocoaheads  
  
This is a Sample Project from a CocoaHeads Sydney Presentation. It isn't a intended to be an example of best practice of testing and patterns, just as a foil for showing how making an implementation more testable makes the code better independent of the tests themselves.  
  
The slides are also available in this repo.  

There are two tags ```bad``` and ```good```. Diff the two to see how the code has been refactored, without functionality changing.
